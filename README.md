## About <a name="About"></a>

The general purpose of **The Green Corner** is gathering plant specifications and identifying flora across the globe. And this anytime, anywhere as this application is available on various devices as desktops, tablets and mobile.

I've decided to create a modern responsive Web tool for gathering plant specifications and identifying flora worldwide. Because I enjoy gardening and I look for information about plants depending on the season (planting, growth, potting, care, trimming, cutting, etc. ) which are located in different places (saved online, written in books/magazines, saved in a folder on my computer, etc.). This was the good opportunity to finally have a single application to gather all my botanic experiences and knowledge centralized in one site. A few friends and family members like plants as well and we like sharing information. With this app I can easily provide all my plant information from only one location and <em>My Green Corner</em> can easily be shared.<br />
In a future version of this app the users will have the possibility to authenticate so it will allow others to store their own plant information, <em>their own Green Corner</em> while having access to all plants information shared.

### Why this project? <a name="WhyThisProject"></a>

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development studies, the **Data Centric Development** module. The objective of this milestone project is building a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain using CRUD operations: **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete the selected dataset.

For this project we could choose from one of the following ideas:
- Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need.
- Create an online cookbook
- Create a jargon glossary/dictionary for a particular domain
- Build a book review and recommendation site

My modern responsive Web tool for gathering plant specifications and identifying flora worldwide is built using HTML, CSS, Materialize CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Flask, Jinja, Python and MongoDB.

### Design <a name="Design"></a>

Ideas which pop up in my mind when people talk about **botanic** and
**gardening** are a calm and relaxing atmosphere, a sober and simple design, Green color obviously but not only, natural colors as well.    
This is why I have designed my entire project around **natural and sober colors** representing the **elements of Nature**.  

I choose first the website logo representing the idea of **identifying flora worldwide**. Then I selected the palette by using the color scheme generator from a photo of the website logo, named [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/image-picker).
From my opinion (I might be wrong :) ) the logo, colors, pictures, the visual design of the website globally, are what people memorize first and it's what people will remember over time. It gives them a first impression and feeling. If the global visual design of the website looks and feels good - if the user like it - he/she will give the application a try. If not they are lot of chances he/she will probably look for another application among the numerous applications available on the market. So visual design and feel is a significant aspect I believe.    

I used the [Parallax Template](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) from Materialize CSS which I customized in my vision of the **elements of Nature** concept. This template was a good base to the sober and simple design I wanted to create.

#### Framework <a name="Framework"></a>

- [Materialize CSS 0.100.2](https://materializecss.com/) - Responsive front-end framework based on Material Design
- [Flask 1.1.2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) - Lightweight (micro) framework for building web applications

#### Color Scheme <a name="ColorScheme"></a>

In keeping with the **the elements of Nature** idea, I have chosen a natural and sober color scheme referring to the elements of Nature. I first choose my [logo](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/planet-earth_1598196?term=plant&page=1&position=41) from Flaticon(https://www.flaticon.com). From there, I used the color scheme generator [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/image-picker) which generated the following [palette](https://coolors.co/98cae9-1c5925-31628b-3caf4e-000000) from my logo picture. And Finally I selected pictures which fit well in my color scheme and in the space allocated.

- ![#98CAE9](https://placehold.it/15/98CAE9/98CAE9) `#98CAE9`- Light Cornflower Blue
- ![#1c5925](https://placehold.it/15/98CAE9/98CAE9) `#1c5925`- Lincoln Green
- ![#31628b](https://placehold.it/15/98CAE9/98CAE9) `#31628b`- Lapis Lazuli

### Wireframes <a name="Wireframes"></a>

I have used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) for my wireframes because:
- Code Institute have provided all students a free licence until end of 2020. I got to use this software a few year ago and I am pretty happy to get the chance to use it again.
- The simplicity, rapidity and ease of use by focusing on structure and content.

My wireframes for this project can be found [here](TO_ADD) in the wireframes sub-directory.

### Data integration <a name="Dataintegration"></a>

I chose to use MongoDB for my project in case the website gets a huge amount of data in the future. I also wanted the user to be able to choose what data they gather in the plant form. I thought MongoDB would offer more flexibility concerning my website.
Moreover before this project I've never used MongoDB so it was the opportunity to get new knowledge and new learning.

## Deployment <a name="Deployment"></a>

### Deployment – Live Website <a name="Deploymentlivewebsite"></a>

This site is currently deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the **master** branch on GitHub. To implement this project on Heroku, the following steps were taken:

1. Create a **requirements.txt** file so Heroku can install the required dependencies to run the app.
    - `sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    - My file can be found [here](TO_ADD).
2. Create a **Procfile** to tell Heroku what type of application is being deployed, and how to run it.
    - `echo web: python run.py > Procfile`
    - My file can be found [here](TO_ADD).
3. Sign up for a free Heroku account, create your project app, and click the **Deploy** tab, at which point you can *Connect GitHub* as the Deployment Method, and select *Enable Automatic Deployment*.
4. In the Heroku **Settings** tab, click on the *Reveal Config Vars* button to configure environmental variables as follows:
    - **IP** : `0.0.0.0`
    - **PORT** : `5000`
    - **MONGO_URI** : `<link to your Mongo DB>`
5. Your app should be successfully deployed to Heroku at this point.

### Deployment – Run Locally <a name="Deploymentrunlocally"></a>

Please note - in order to run this project locally on your own system, you will need the following installed:
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads) to run the application.
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing) to install all app requirements.
- Any IDE.
- [GIT](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) for cloning and version control.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) to develop your own database either locally or remotely on MongoDB Atlas.

Next, there's a series of steps to take in order to proceed with local deployment:

- Clone this GitHub repository by either clicking the green *Clone or download* button and downloading the project as a zip-file (remember to unzip it first), or by entering the following into the Git CLI terminal:
    - `git clone TO_ADD`.
- Navigate to the correct file location after unpacking the files.
    - `cd <path to folder>`
- Create a `.env` file with your credentials. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/bravoalpha79/environment-variables#how-to-set-up-python-environment-variables-in-gitpod). Be sure to include your *MONGO_URI*
- Install all requirements from the [requirements.txt](TO_ADD) file using this command:
    - `sudo -H pip3 -r requirements.txt`
- Sign up for a free account on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and create a new Database called **the_green_corner**. The *Collections* in that database should be as follows:  
	- [database documentation](TO_ADD) in the database sub-directory
	- [database diagram](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/sYgu2Z) or [here](TO_ADD) in the database sub-directory


**Plants**
```
PlantID PK int
ScientificName string
CommonName string
Genus string
Species string
Family string
Category string FK >- Categories.CategoryName
PlantType string FK >- PlantTypes.PlantTypeName
ShadeTolerance string FK >- ShadeTolerance.ShadeToleranceName
Note NULL string
```

**Categories**
```
CategoryID PK int
CategoryName string
```

**PlantTypes** as pt
```
PlantTypeID PK int
PlantTypeName string
```

**ShadeTolerance** as st
```
ShadeToleranceID PK int
ShadeToleranceName string
```

- You should now be able to launch your app using the following command in your terminal:
    - `python app.py`
- The app should now be running on *localhost* on an address similar to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Simply copy/paste this into the browser of your choice!
